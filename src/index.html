						<p>For this lesson, we’ll use this dataset of property sales. It has one row per property sold, and columns with some information about each property.</p>
						<p>Take a moment to explore the dataset.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='2'>
						<p>A common task in machine learning is to train a computer to distinguish between different groups, or classes.</p>
						<p>In our dataset, each row is either a house, or an apartment. These 2 groups will be our classes.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='3'>
						<p>This data comes from a popular real estate listings website. Sometimes, the website’s users don’t fill out the &#39;property type&#39; field, so there are some rows that have a missing value in that column.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='4'>
						<p>How could we train a computer to predict whether a new row is a house or an apartment?</p>
						<p>The task above is asking us to train a computer to determine the class of a new row. This kind of task is called a classification task. We will solve it by using a classification algorithm.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='5'>
						<p>But first, let’s take a step back and graph this data. We’ll create a scatterplot, with a horizontal axis representing the property size, and a vertical axis representing the property price.</p>

						<p>Red dots will be houses, and blue ones will be apartments.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='7'>
						<p>Now let’s add a few more datapoints from the same dataset, to make this more interesting.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='8'>
						<p>What a beautiful scatterplot! Now that we have the data plotted, let’s introduce the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to solve our classification task.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='9'>
						<p>Let’s say we have this new datapoint— a property that sold for $XXX thousand, and has 720 square feet of space.</p>
						<p>The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm will look at the nearest neighbors of this new datapoint, and will tally up how many of them are houses, and how many are apartments.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='10'>
						<p>How many neighbors will KNN look at?</p>
						<p>That’s what K stands for! It’s the number of nearest neighbors to tally up! Let’s say that K is 5 for now.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='11'>
						<p>How does KNN know which datapoints are the nearest neighbors?</p>
						<p>It calculates the distance from the new datapoint, (at location $XXX k, 5) to every other datapoint on the grid. Then it chooses the top 5.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='12'>
						<p>Then it will take the majority vote of those 5 datapoints, and that is the algorithm’s guess about what the mysterious new datapoint is.</p>
						<p>In this case, 4/5 of the nearest neighbors are apartments— so our best guess is that this new datapoint is an apartment.</p>
